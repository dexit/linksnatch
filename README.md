## Introduction

This is a dead simple bookmarks app that lets you save the links on your device on the go.

I built [LinkSnatch](https://linksnatch.pages.dev) because I wanted something really simple to save links that I wanted to read later. I didn't want to have to sign up for an account, I didn't want to have to install a browser extension, and I didn't want to have to use a bookmarking service that was going to track me. I wanted something pretty simple that just works. And here I am!

The app is fairly opinionated and comes with a set of bare minimum features I would need:

- A beautiful interface with minimal distractions.
- Extracts URL metadata using [jsonlink.io](https://jsonlink.io) and saves it to the browser's local storage.
- Save and search links all from a single place.
- Dark mode.
- It doesn't track you.
- No signup needed.
- It doesn't require you to install a browser extension.
- It's open source.
  
I started building it to solve my own itch but later realized that someone might be in need of something like this. And so, I decided to set it free out in the wild!
